# whatsapp-analysis
Tools to analyse your whatsapp data.

Get and display various statistics from your whatsapp chats directly from the encrypted database files.


### How to get the key and database files ?

You can root your phone, or you can simply enable end-to-end encryption in the whatsapp settings. 
Once it is done and you copied the 64 characters key, you can make a backup of your messages in whatsapp and then copy the encrypted database files ("msgstore.db.crypt15") from your phone's files.
The decryption here is done with [wa-crypt-tools](https://github.com/ElDavoo/wa-crypt-tools).
